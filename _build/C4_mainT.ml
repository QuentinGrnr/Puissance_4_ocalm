(* Once the general game skeleton has been written, games may be played in 
   various ways. Two human players may play against each other, with the program merely
   verifying the validity of the moves; a person may play against a programmed player;
   or programs may play against each other. While this last mode might not be interesting 
   for the human, it does make it easy to run tests without having to wait for a person's 
   responses. The following game demonstrates this scenario. *)
